# Horiseon refactor

In this assignment, I *refactored* a marketing groups website to make the HTML and CSS more readable, following proper syntax guidelines. I did my best to follow the *scout* rule, which is to leave a page of code a little cleaner than I found it. I also added comments on the HTML and CSS files to enable navigation of the page at a glance. I did these things to ensure that, if the page ever needs updating, or bugs are found, the process of maintaining the site would be as painless as possible. I accomplished this by using various tools; *google searches, chrome developer tools, and various examples used in class* to analyze and, later, utilize the proper procedures I had learned.
